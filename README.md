This is source generating the website for the Math Club at CUNY
College of Staten Island. To change the website content, edit the
`.qmd` files or add new files here. For any more advanced tricks,
reach out to @michiexile for help picking or changing a template or
generating more interesting structures.

The top navigation bar is controlled by entries in the file
`_quarto.yml`. Each `.md` or `.qmd` file that has a file header will
generate a page on the website. The Quarto documentation has
[extensive information](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) for how to
write a website with the Quarto system.
